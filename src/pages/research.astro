        My research bridges soil genesis, environmental geochemistry, and climate science to reveal how mineral weathering and pedogenic transformation regulate the Earth’s carbon cycle. Focusing on ultramafic and basaltic systems, I integrate magnetic, mineralogical, and biogeochemical approaches to decode how soils evolve and interact with the atmosphere. Ultimately, I seek to transform our understanding of soils—from passive records of Earth’s history into active agents of carbon removal and planetary resilience.      </p>
      <p class="text-lg mb-6">
        I study how soils evolve through the interplay of climate, parent material, and time — integrating geochemistry, mineral magnetism, and isotopic tracing to reveal how landscapes archive the Earth’s environmental and geochemical history, from ultramafic terrains to carbon-sequestering systems.

    <p class="text-lg mb-6">
      My research focuses on the mechanisms of soil formation (pedogenesis) across ultramafic and serpentine landscapes. By integrating mineral magnetism, geochemistry, and isotopic analyses, I uncover how parent material, climate, and time interact to shape soil mineralogy and trace element behavior. This approach not only deepens our understanding of how soils evolve as dynamic geological systems, but also provides a process-based framework for evaluating carbon cycling, metal mobility, and long-term ecosystem development. Through this lens, my work contributes to reinterpreting soils as historical archives of Earth’s surface transformation and as active agents in global environmental change.    </p>
