Soil science has grown on the back of a simple yet easily overlooked truth:
**Most of the materials human societies use come from soil and rock.**

Rice, bread, fruits, vegetables—all come from the land. Water comes from rivers and groundwater that flow through the land. Air is filled with dust lifted from the earth. The metals and non-metals in our tech products come from deep within the strata.

Even the crisp white clothes that keep us clean from dust contain cotton and flax grown from the soil, animal fibers nurtured on grasslands, and chemical fibers drawn from deep sedimentary layers. More surprisingly, soil pH influences the softness of cotton; the calcium–magnesium balance affects the strength of flax and ramie; trace elements shape the curl and elasticity of wool. Soil organic matter shifts cellulose content in timber, affecting synthetic fiber quality. Even petroleum is the compressed remains of ancient organic matter.

From antiquity to now, soil has been indispensable to human society.
**It is the medium for food, culture, writing, and rest—the place where all existence is set down.**

In Aristotle’s language, “earth (γῆ)” is a natural quality that sinks, steadies, and solidifies; soil is its manifestation in the world. If we say “living bodies contain the quality of earth,” we can also understand that life itself carries a soil-like inclination.

So, reaching for the soil is a human instinct. Yet, somewhere along the way, this first-hand touch and understanding became the homeland left behind as civilization built upward.

In the arenas I see, soil science is fading from view. Departments merge, research funds shrink, expert numbers decline year by year. Piece these fragments together, and it is hard not to worry: are we slowly neglecting the most fundamental knowledge of the land?

**Do we really understand soil well enough? Is investing in soil exploration a departure from society’s direction?**

These questions surface quietly whenever I run experiments, write papers, or organize data. The causes are complex: society’s high expectations for technology, competition for academic resources, and neglect of basic natural sciences. These forces intertwine, pushing soil science down the priority list in many countries.

From wartime land surveys to fertility studies during land reclamation, to soil maps drawn to boost land-use efficiency, people have invested in exploring classification, morphology, and pedogenesis. Each step is difficult: soil is where solid, liquid, and gas meet; countless physical, chemical, and biological reactions occur there simultaneously or intermittently.

In the late 19th century (around the 1880s–1890s), Vasily Dokuchaev first regarded soil as an independent natural body. Through systematic studies of profiles such as chernozems, he demonstrated that soil properties are jointly shaped by parent material, climate, vegetation, and time—laying the foundation of modern pedology. Later, in 1941, Hans Jenny structured these ideas and proposed the five well-known
**“soil-forming factors”**: climate, organisms, topography, parent material, and time—now central to soil genesis research.

Yet in the 21st century, soil scientists can no longer, and do not want to, keep their focus inside those five factors. We extend the concepts into geology and hydrology, agricultural production, industrial pollution remediation, critical technology elements, and risk assessment, because today’s problems lie far beyond any single discipline.
