Rice cultivation sustains over half of the global population but remains a major anthropogenic source of methane and nitrous oxide. Identifying strategies that can simultaneously maintain crop productivity and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions is therefore essential for climate-resilient agriculture.  

My current research investigates **enhanced basalt weathering (EBW)** as a potential pathway to achieve this dual objective. By accelerating the dissolution of silicate minerals, basalt amendment can **capture atmospheric CO₂**, **modify soil redox and pH conditions**, and **influence the biogeochemical cycling** of carbon and nitrogen in flooded soils.  

Our field experiments in temperate and tropical paddy systems integrate **soil mineralogy, geochemistry, and gas flux measurements** to quantify how basalt weathering alters soil processes and emission dynamics. Through this work, we aim to develop a mechanistic understanding of **how mineral–soil–plant interactions can contribute to long-term greenhouse gas mitigation** while improving soil quality and crop performance.  

This research represents a step toward uniting **pedology, geochemistry, and global science** in designing sustainable, nature-based climate solutions grounded in Earth’s own processes.
