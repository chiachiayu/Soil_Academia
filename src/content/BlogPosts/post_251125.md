When I officially stepped into soil science, I realized that this discipline grows from a simple truth we tend to forget:

Most of what human societies rely on comes, in the end, from soil and rock.

The foods that fill our tables, the water that keeps us alive, the dust that floats in the air, the metals inside our phones and computers—all of them trace back to the earth beneath our feet.

Even the clothes that feel clean and crisp against our skin carry the imprint of soil: cotton softens or stiffens with soil pH, the balance of calcium and magnesium influences the strength of flax and ramie fibers, and the curl of wool is shaped by trace elements taken up from pasture soils. Soil organic matter alters cellulose content in timber, which in turn affects the quality of synthetic fibers. Even petroleum—something that seems so distant from everyday landscapes—is the compressed memory of ancient organic matter.

From antiquity to now, soil has always accompanied human life.
It has carried our food, our culture, our writing, our labor—and eventually, our rest.

Aristotle once described “earth (γῆ)” as a natural quality that steadies and settles. Soil is that quality made visible. If living bodies hold something of this “earth,” then perhaps life itself has a soil-like nature: grounded, persistent, quietly shaping everything else.

Maybe this is why touching soil feels strangely familiar. Yet as societies rise upward—toward cities, technologies, and abstractions—the understanding of soil has slowly slipped behind us, like a homeland we left without noticing.

Today, the field I work in sometimes feels like it is fading from public view. Departments merge, funding tightens, and the number of specialists declines. When I assemble these pieces in my mind, I cannot help but wonder:

Do we truly understand soil? And if we keep investing in this field, are we moving against the direction of the world—or quietly defending its foundations?

These questions follow me whenever I write a manuscript, run a field campaign, or spend long evenings sorting data. The reasons behind this decline are tangled: rising expectations for technology, intense competition for resources, and the gradual sidelining of the basic natural sciences. Soil science, being both ancient and quietly complex, often gets pushed to the margins.

But the history of the field tells a different story.

From wartime land surveys, to soil maps for agricultural planning, to the first systematic studies of soil profiles—people have always returned to the ground to understand how land supports life. Soil is not easy to study: it is where solids, liquids, and gases meet; countless chemical and biological reactions run in parallel, sometimes rhythmically, sometimes unpredictably.

In the late 19th century, Vasily Dokuchaev made a decisive step by treating soil as its own natural body. Working through profiles like chernozems, he argued that soil properties arise from parent material, climate, vegetation, and time. Later, in 1941, Hans Jenny organized these ideas into the classic soil-forming factors: climate, organisms, topography, parent material, and time.

As a young researcher today, I often return to these foundations—not to stay within them, but to understand why the field has grown beyond them. Modern soil science can no longer stay inside five categories. Our work spills into geology and hydrology, agriculture and pollution remediation, critical elements and environmental risks. The questions we face now are simply too broad for any single boundary.

This piece is part of my own attempt to trace where soil science comes from, and where my generation might bring it.
