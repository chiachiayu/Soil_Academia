		title: 'Genesis and mass balance of basaltic soils along a lava plateau chronosequence in Penghu Islands, Taiwan',
		authors: 'Yang,C.Y., C.Y. Huang,  Z.Y. Hseu',
		journal: 'Journal of Soil Science and Plant Nutrition',

		abstract: 'Basalt-derived soils are important to global biogeochemical cycles due to their extensive distribution and rapid weathering. The Penghu Islands, located in the Taiwan Strait, provide an ideal setting to investigate the effects of time on pedogenesis within a basaltic chronosequence under humid tropical conditions. Four pedons – PH1, PH2, PH3, and PH4—developed on basaltic lava with stratigraphic ages of 8.5, 9.3, 10.6, and 12 Ma, respectively, were collected. The morphological, physio-chemical, and mineralogical properties of soils were analyzed. A geochemical mass balance approach was conducted to obtain the τj, w value of each element for evaluating the gain and loss of elements. A progressive increase in solum thickness, clay accumulation, and rubification with stratigraphic age were identified, highlighting long-term pedogenic transformations. Younger soils (PH1, PH2), classified as Typic Ustorthents, exhibited minimal horizon development, while older soils (PH3, PH4), classified as Typic Haplustalfs, were characterized by well-developed Bt horizons and high crystallinity of secondary Fe oxides. Mass balance analysis revealed significant elemental depletion, particularly for Si, Al, and Fe, consistent with progressive weathering. However, the τj, w values of Ca and Mg implied net accumulation, suggesting sustained external inputs from marine-derived carbonates and eolian deposition. The τj, w values of trace metals, including Cr and Ni, displayed irregular trends with depth and stratigraphic age, indicating complex interactions between primary mineral dissolution and secondary mineral adsorption. Despite its utility in quantifying element fluxes, mass balance analysis proved inadequate for fully capturing the effect of time on pedogenesis in an open-system environment influenced by external inputs. The lack of a significant correlation between element depletion patterns and plateau age suggested that processes such as eolian deposition, marine carbonate addition, and hydrological influenced variability that cannot be resolved through mass balance alone. This study disentangled in situ weathering from allochthonous contributions, providing a more comprehensive understanding of basaltic soil evolution in dynamic coastal landscapes.',

		abstract: 'The geochemical behaviors of chromium (Cr) and nickel (Ni) associated with rare earth elements (REEs) have received limited attention in ultramafic soils. This study hypothesized that ultramafic soils originating from distinct ophiolite complexes exhibit varying amounts of Cr and Ni, with REEs fractionation serving as a fingerprint in these soils. A total of 39 horizon samples from eight pedons, including Entisols, Inceptisols and Alfisols, were collected at different landscape positions from three ophiolite complexes in eastern Taiwan. The total concentrations of major elements, Cr, Ni and REEs were determined. Linear correlation and principal component analysis (PCA) were then used to assess variations in the signatures of REEs corresponding to soil properties, Cr, and Ni. The soils from different ophiolite complexes exhibited various Cr and Ni abundance, and signatures of REEs. REEs remained immobile as their concentrations increased during pedogenesis. The ratio between light REEs (LREEs) and heavy REEs (HREEs) of the soils indicated an enrichment of LREEs compared to HREEs. A common minerals origin of REEs and Cr existed. Thus, REEs and Cr underwent similar geochemical processes in the soils. Additionally, Ce anomaly (δCe) increased along with REEs, Cr, and Ni, corresponding to the formation of secondary iron oxides. Differentiation in ΣREEs, Cr, Ni, ΣLREEs/ΣHREEs, (La/Sm)N, (La/Yb)N, (Gd/Yb)N, and δCe by the PCA can be used to separate the soils from various ophiolite complexes, identifying the origins of these soils in Taiwan. However, further validation with additional data from diverse pedoclimate regions is required for future studies.',

		abstract: 'Rare earth elements (REEs) are emerging contaminants rendering potential risks in soils to environmental quality and human health. The causation between their geochemical signatures and contamination levels with parent rocks and soil properties are critical for REEs risk assessments, which are urgently needed globally. Thus, this study aimed to elucidate cause-and-effect among hydrofluoric-acid-digested total and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid extracted bioavailable soil REEs and their contamination degree evaluated by pollution indices in 268 soil layer (horizon) samples from 50 soil profiles derived from felsic, intermediate, mafic, ultramafic, and sedimentary rocks in Taiwan. The total REEs was 133 ± 61.9 mg/kg and all individual REEs were classified as minimal contamination by the enrichment factor. The highest total soil REEs was from granite, followed by sandstone and shale, mafic rocks, andesite, and ultramafic rocks. All soils were ranked as significantly pollution risk by the pollution loading index. Furthermore, REEs were accumulated in all subsoils due to the co-translocation with soil colloids during the intensive leaching, corresponding with their higher geoaccumulation index value than those in surface soils. The contamination degree and bioavailable REEs significantly increased with the increasing total REEs. However, the stronger sequestration of clay and free Fe oxides for heavy REEs (HREEs) over light REEs (LREEs) mitigated their bioavailability, especially in the highly weathered soils like Ultisols and Oxisols. This study highlighted the dominance of soil properties in REEs fractionation, where the preferential fixation of soil colloids for HREEs throughout soil profiles reduced their uptake risk for biome even under the rising contamination potential.'

		abstract:'The ophiolite complex in Chishang, Eastern Taiwan, exhibits a wide variety of soil parent materials, resulting in notable variations in elemental composition and pedological properties. This study characterized soils from four pedons along a toposequence, focusing on mineral composition, micromorphology, general properties, and elemental composition. A mass balance model quantified the mobility of clay, along with major and trace elements. The soils predominantly comprised chlorites, feldspars, quartz, micas, and calcite, with higher silica (Si) concentrations followed by Al. Some of the studied soils had elevated Ca/Mg ratios (≥ 1.0), indicating a primary derivation from sedimentary parent material, such as mudstone. However, concentrations of Cr (71.2 to 105.0 mg kg⁻¹), Ni (43.2 mg kg⁻¹), and Co (20.3 to 27.9 mg kg⁻¹) were notably lower than those reported in other global studies on ophiolite complexes. A significant and positive correlation occurred between Fe- and Al-oxides and Cr, Ni, and Co. The poor correlations between these trace metals and other soil properties (pH, organic carbon, Ca/Mg ratio, rare earth elements) suggest that these factors had limited influence on Cr, Ni, and Co concentrations. The strong (p < 0.01) correlations among trace metals indicate a genetic linkage formed during soil development rather than anthropogenic activities. Additionally, trace metal enrichment in surface soils, as evidenced by the increase of clay and Fe/Al oxides, implies that these components provide crucial adsorption sites for Cr, Ni, and Co. '

		title: 'How magnetism-based fractional spinels contribute to the bioavailability of geogenic chromium in serpentine soils of Taiwan',

		abstract: 'Serpentine soils are highly rich in geogenic chromium (Cr), typically associated with spinel minerals. The high resistance of these minerals to weathering has raised concerns regarding their contribution to Cr bioavailability in serpentine soils. This study collected soil horizon samples from two pedons (Entisol and Ultisol) in eastern Taiwan and applied a two-step magnetic separation method to divide the bulk soils into strongly magnetic (SM), weakly magnetic (WM), and nonmagnetic (NM) fractions. The basic characteristics of the bulk soils were examined. To characterize the mineralogy and geochemistry of the fractions and determine their quantitative contribution of bioavailable Cr in serpentine soils, we analyzed their mineral composition, magnetic properties, and elemental composition and valence by using various spectrometric techniques, such as X-ray diffraction, electron probe microanalysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy, as well as vibrating sample magnetometry. The results indicated the main Cr-bearing minerals were magnetite and chromite in the SM and WM fractions, with minor occurrences in layer silicates, such as serpentine and chlorite, in the NM fraction. The total Cr content decreased in the following order: SM > WM > NM. The SM fraction had the lowest weight proportion, and this proportion was lower for the Ultisol than the Entisol. This observation indicated that the weathering of Cr spinels is associated with the substantial cation substitution of Al, Ca, Mn, and Ni for Fe and Cr in broken mineral grains and increases in the Fe(III) and Cr(VI) concentrations in magnetite. The SM fraction, mainly consists of magnetite and chromite, exhibited the highest concentration of bioavailable Cr extracted by 0.1 M HCl. However, the Cr-bearing layer silicates represented the largest potential pool of bioavailable Cr in the bulk soils because the weight proportion of the NM fraction was higher than those of the other fractions and increased during pedogenesis.',

		abstract: 'Serpentinite-derived soils are characterized by low Ca/Mg ratio and abnormally high Cr and Ni concentrations due to the geogenic sources. The breakdown of parent materials during pedogenesis may lead to the changes in both Ca/Mg ratios and fractions of Cr and Ni. This study hypothesized that total Ca/Mg (Cat/Mgt) and exchangeable Ca/Mg (Cae/Mge) ratios increase with soil development, associated with the increases in potentially mobile fractions (PMFs) of Cr and Ni. Thirty-five soil horizon samples of eight pedons from Japan, Taiwan, Philippines, and Vietnam were collected, and the exchangeable concentrations of Ca and Mg were measured. The fractions of Cr and Ni were further determined by the BCR sequential extraction, and the sum of the acid soluble, reducible, and oxidizable fractions was regarded as the PMFs of Cr and Ni. Based on the elemental and mineral analyses, the studied samples from different countries varied in the parent materials. The elemental mappings with electron probe microanalysis elucidated that the sources of Cr and Mg were spinels and silicates, such as chromite, serpentine, and chlorite, while those of Ni were the silicates. The Cae/Mge ratio was a potential index of weathering degree of the soils. The PMF of Cr mainly associated with the organic matter and Fe/Mn oxides increased during pedogenesis, corresponding to the significant (P < 0.05) increase in Cae/Mge ratio. Furthermore, the PMF of Cr was predicted by a function of Cat/Mgt and Cae/Mge ratios, clay, and organic carbon using multivariate linear regression analysis. Although the PMF of Ni was poorly correlated with the Cae/Mge ratio, it was predicted by Cat/Mgt and Cae/Mge ratios, total Ni, and dithionite-citrate-bicarbonate extractable Fe. These results supported that the breakdown of serpentinitic framework led to loss of Mg, increase of Ca/Mg ratios, and increase of Cr and Ni in PMFs during pedogenesis.',

		abstract: 'Chromium (Cr)(VI) is carcinogenic; thus, the excessive presence of Cr(VI) in soils can pose potential risks to water quality, food safety, and human health. The kinetics of Cr(VI) reduction in soils are important for assessing the fate of Cr in the environment. The present study tested physio-chemical and microbial properties in twenty-eight agricultural soils collected in Taiwan to evaluate the relationship between the reduction rate of Cr(VI) and soil properties, using 49-day incubation at 25 °C. At the beginning of incubation, 100 mg Cr(VI) kg−1 was spiked into the soils. The reduction of Cr(VI) was described by first-order kinetics at a significant level (p < 0.05) for the tested soils. The rate constant (k) of Cr(VI) reduction ranged from 0.01 to 4.21 day−1. In addition, the k value significantly increased with organic carbon (OC) and cation exchange capacity, but significantly decreased with increasing pH and dithionite-citrate-bicarbonate extractable Mn (Mnd). However, a predictive model using stepwise regression analysis indicated that the k value of the kinetics was controlled by OC, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and Mnd, thereby identifying the complex interactions between Cr(VI) reduction and soil factors in the humid tropics.',
